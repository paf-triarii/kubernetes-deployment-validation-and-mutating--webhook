This repository contains a well detailed PoC about an specific use case: enabling custom validation and mutating webhook for your Kubernetes deployments based on a set of rules.
There are many solutions out there like OPA Gatekeeper or Kyverno specialized for this.
However, understanding how could you configure your custom server for validation or mutating webhook can provide you even farther flexibility if needed.

<!-- PROJECT DETAILS -->
## 💡 Structure


## 🚀 Installation and Execution

### 🔨 Prerequisites

- Docker
- Python 3.10+
- Kubectl
- yq (only for Kubernetes deployment).

```bash
sudo wget -qO /usr/local/bin/yq https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/yq
```

### 🗜️ Preparations

1. Build required docker images and upload to your cluster registry. Other option is to use my already publish image in DockerHub.

```bash
docker build . -f docker/Dockerfile.service -t uvicorn:1.0
```

2. [Optional] Generate self-signed certs for caddy. Omit this step if you have your own certificates for TLS exposure.

```bash
# Make sure to set your target domain and ip
./gen_certs.sh --domain codetriarii.org --ip 172.20.140.18
```

### Deployment Path 1: Server outside the cluster - Docker

If you want to deploy the server outside the cluster, make sure to follow these steps:

1. [Optional] If you have your own certs, place those in `certs` folder. Ensure naming is `ca.crt`, `cert.crt` and `cert.key`.

2. Start the server with `docker compose`.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate
```

### Deployment Path 2: Installing it in the kubernetes cluster - Kubernetes

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> For kubernetes, you must generate the certs with CN expected the service name to avoid TLS errors.

```bash
./gen_certs.sh --domain uvicorn-service.demo.svc --ip 127.0.0.1
```



1. Create the tls secret from your certs (either the ones you have placed in `certs` folder or the automatically generated ones.)

```bash
kubectl create ns demo
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace demo
kubectl create secret tls uvicorn-tls-secret --cert=certs/cert.crt --key=certs/cert.key
```

2. Create the deployment.

```bash
kubectl create -f kubernetes/uvicorn-deployment.yaml
```

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> If you are using your own built image, then make sure to change the `image` of the deployment and include `imagePullSecrets` if required (if your registry is authorized as it should be...)

#### Configuring the WebHooks

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> Kubernetes versions enable by default `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` and `MutatingAdmissionWebhook`. Ensure both plugins are enabled in your cluster. If not, just include both in `--enable-admission-plugins=` flag of `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` of your master(s) node.

1. Set the ca-bundle from `certs` folder.

```bash
{
   ca_bundle=$(cat certs/ca.crt | base64 -w0)
   yq read kubernetes/validation-webhook.yaml -j | jq ".webhooks[].clientConfig.caBundle = \"${ca_bundle}\"" | yq read -P - > kubernetes/validation-webhook.yaml.bak
   mv kubernetes/validation-webhook.yaml.bak kubernetes/validation-webhook.yaml
}
```

2. Create the validation and mutating webhook definitions:

```bash
kubectl create -f kubernetes/validation-webhook.yaml
kubectl create -f kubernetes/mutating-webhook.yaml
```
