This repository contains a well detailed PoC about an specific use case: enabling custom validation and mutating webhook for your Kubernetes deployments based on a set of rules.
There are many solutions out there like OPA Gatekeeper or Kyverno specialized for this.
However, understanding how could you configure your custom server for validation or mutating webhook can provide you even farther flexibility if needed.
